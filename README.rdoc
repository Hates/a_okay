= AOkay

Simple controller that spits out if the server is reponding. Created after I stupidly set Pingdom to search for a specific term on our homepage, creating a huge spike in our MixPanel analytics.
Now Pingdom just looks at /a_okay and tests for the string "Everything is a-okay!"

= What it does

/a_okay
> "Everything is a-okay!"
