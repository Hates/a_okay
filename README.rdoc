= AOkay

Simple controller that spits out if the server is reponding. Created after I stupidly set Pingdom to search for a specific term on our homepage, creating a huge spike in our MixPanel analytics.
Now Pingdom just looks at /a_okay and tests for the string "Everything is a okay!"

In the future I hope to add "a okay" testing for:

* Database connections
* Mailers
* Er, can't think of anythign else right now.
